Spiral Primes

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length
7 is formed.

        [37]     36      35      34      33      32     [31]
         38     [17]     16      15      14     [13]     30
         39      18     [ 5]      4     [ 3]     12      29
         40      19       6       1       2      11      28
         41      20     [ 7]      8       9      10      27
         42      21      22      23      24      25      26
        [43]     44      45      46      47      48      49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is
more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a
ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9
will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for
which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
